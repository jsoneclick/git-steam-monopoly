Steam Monopoly
Hello there my friend!

////////////////////////////////////

Steam Monopoly is a web board game made on a original Monopoly base. Instead of streets, cities or other staff, my game can offer you some cool Steam Games.

Play with your friends on one device (1 game session = 1 device) 'cause it is local(not online)

///////////////////////////////////

Game written on htmls/css/js (Started desining/developing 5.01.23)

Just download zip-archive

Good luck and have fun with your friends!
